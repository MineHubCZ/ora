# ORA

ORA (she/her) is st**ora**ge usage checker written in php.

## Why php?

I wanted to use rust or lisp but i wanted to make it quickly so i chosed php. Lisp anbd rust will be another time.

## Usage

- Install:
```sh
$ git clone  https://github.com/MineHubCZ/ora.git
```

- Create config:
```sh
$ php ora.php config <editor>
```

- Run:
```sh
$ php ora.php 
```

This will check once so its recommended to use cron job.
